    <h2>Trader Joe's - http://www.traderjoes.com/</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Answer 1:</strong> My first impression of the Trader Joe's website is that it's clean and does a good job at capturing the company's more traditional branding. Comparing it to sites like Walmart or Target shows it has a bit more life to it compared to how corperate and streamlined the big brands are.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Answer 2:</strong> The site has a hamburger menu for organization. When you click the icon, it brings up all the different categories of goods to purchase. There is also a search function that is always present at the top.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Answer 3:</strong> The site structure makes sense and is not confusing at all. I don't have any issues finding what i'm looking for while using the site. I think it is less confusing because it follows typical website organization standards. At this point I know how most sites are organized and this one doesn't do anything that throws off my expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Answer 4:</strong> The graphics and layout don't distract in a negative way. They help the brand to differentiate itself from other stores but don't get in the way. Comparing again to Target, it doesn't have so many ads pushed to you in the home page, which I found distracting.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Answer 5:</strong> It took less than 1 second on my internet, so very good load times.    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Answer 6:</strong> The text is very readable. It uses a dark, almost black color for body text on a plain white background, which provides a great contrast. I don't think you can go wrong with white/black for a website. It's boring, but it works.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Answer 7:</strong> The hamburger icon is always present, so it's easy to view any categories at any time. After visiting a specific category, the site will show the "path" to get there at the top Ex: Home>Products>Food>Bakery. It makes it very easy to backtrack if needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Answer 8:</strong> The site has a very consistent color scheme and "look and feel." The brand's classic red color is used as an accent color throughout. The same fonts and illustrative style are used on all pages, and they are all the same color throughout.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Answer 9:</strong> The site has great responsive design. When the browser window is made smaller while you are viewing a particular category The top navigation links on the left collapses into a the "hamburger" menu icon to make more room for the products being viewed. It reacts well to how much space is available.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Answer 10:</strong> I wouldn't say there is anything in particular that catches my eye or is done exceptionaly well, but in my opinion that isn't an issue for this brand. The thing that is "well done" is that the site works exactly as you would expect. You visit the Trader Joe's website to browse their grocery options, and you will have no problem doing this with their current design. I think if they tried to do too much it would only distract and make a worse shopping experience for the average customer.
