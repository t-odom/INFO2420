    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>Welcome to RentAPet, where we believe in the joy and therapeutic power of animal companionship, available to everyone. Our mission is to provide temporary homes and loving interactions for our wonderful animals, while offering people the chance to experience the happiness a pet can bring without the long-term commitment. Whether you're a student missing your dog back home, a family wanting to teach your children about responsibility, or an office looking for a morale boost, we have a furry, scaly, or feathered friend for you.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>

    <p>Our process is simple and designed with the well-being of our animals as the top priority. All our pets are well-trained, socialized, and receive regular veterinary check-ups. You can browse our available companions online and book a rental period that works for you, from a few hours to a full weekend. We provide all the necessary supplies, including food, toys, and a cozy bed, to ensure a comfortable and happy experience for both you and your temporary pet.</p>
    <p>We are dedicated to responsible pet ownership and creating positive connections, one rental at a time.</p>
