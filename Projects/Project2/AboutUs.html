        Galactic Getaways was founded by Dr. Aris Thorne, a former astrophysicist and lifelong space enthusiast. After years of studying the galaxy from afar, Dr. Thorne wanted to share the profound experience of seeing our universe up close. His vision and dedication to safety and wonder are at the core of everything we do.
